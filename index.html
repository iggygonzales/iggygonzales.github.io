    <p id = 'main'>Hi, my name is Miguel Gonzales, and I am a fourth-year student at Northeastern University pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Data Science and Business Administration with a concentration in Business Analytics. I am from Quincy, Massachusetts, which is only a 20-minute drive away from campus. People tend to describe me as unselfish, observant, and trustworthy. In my day-to-day life, I like to use data and technology to try to live efficiently. For example, when I go to the gym to work out, I tend to do the workouts that are proven to grow the muscle the most, or when Iâ€™m hungry, I try to seek the best deals and make the best bang for my buck decision. This makes sense because in my co-op class, we had to take a Clifton strengths assessment, and a notable top strength was analytical. The analytical theme kinda goes hand in hand with some of my interests. Basketball has always been a love of mine and checking the analytics and statistics of each player. Data, analytics, and technology have always been in my interests growing up, and I would love to have a career in one of those fields eventually. Some of my hobbies include walking my dogs, playing basketball, going to the gym, snowboarding, traveling, and trying new things.
