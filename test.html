    <h2> A topic that interts me</h2>
    <p class = "A"> NBA analytics have revolutionized basketball by providing teams with data-driven insights that enhance performance, strategy, and player development. Advanced statistics such as Player Efficiency Rating (PER), True Shooting Percentage (TS%), and Box Plus-Minus (BPM) allow coaches and analysts to evaluate players beyond traditional stats like points and rebounds. The rise of tracking technology, including SportVU cameras, has enabled teams to measure player movement, shot selection, and defensive positioning with incredible accuracy. This data has led to a shift in playing styles, emphasizing efficiencyâ€”teams now prioritize three-pointers and layups over mid-range jumpers, as analytics show these shots yield higher expected points. Additionally, defensive schemes have evolved; teams use analytics to optimize matchups, predict opponents' plays, and refine switching strategies. Load management is another major impact, as teams use biometric data and workload tracking to prevent injuries and maximize player longevity. Front offices also leverage analytics for roster construction, using salary cap modeling and advanced metrics to identify undervalued players. Even fans engage with the game differently, as analytics-driven insights fuel discussions and enhance fantasy sports. As data continues to evolve, NBA analytics will keep shaping how the game is played, making basketball smarter, more efficient, and increasingly strategic. </p>

    <h3>New Stats NBA teams are looking at: </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Expected Shot Value (ESV)</li>
        <dl>This metric evaluates the expected points a shot should generate based on factors like shot location, defender proximity, and shooter ability. It helps teams optimize shot selection.</dl>
        <li>Shot Quality (SQ) & Shot Probability (SP)</li>
        <dl>These stats assess whether a player is taking a high-percentage shot based on their past performance and the defensive contest level.</dl>
        <li>Defensive Matchup Data & Versatility Index</li>
        <dl>With tracking data, teams analyze how effective defenders are against different types of offensive players, helping strategize matchups and defensive rotations.</dl>
    </ol>
